Started in April 2017, NUKE is a free, open-source **build automation system for C#/.NET**. It runs on **any platform** (.NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono) and **integrates natively** with all IDEs (VisualStudio, JetBrains Rider, etc.). While builds are **bootstrapped with conventional scripts** (_build.ps1_ or _build.sh_), their actual implementation is based on simple **C# console applications**. This allows IDE features like code-completion, refactorings and debugging to be used as usual. One further step is that **build steps are actual symbols** (expression-bodied properties) and therefore provide superior navigation and type-safety.<!-- NUKE supports a variety of CLI tools commonly used in .NET  Utilizing **code-generation for CLI tool support** allows NUKE to powerful, flexible and consistent API for-->
