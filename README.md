It runs **cross-platform** on .NET Core, .NET Framework, or Mono and **integrates natively** with all major IDEs like VisualStudio, JetBrains Rider, or VSCode. While builds are **bootstrapped with conventional scripts** - for instance, _build.ps1_ or _build.sh_ files - their actual implementation resides mainly in simple **C# console applications**. This allows IDE features like code-completion, refactorings and debugging to be used as out-of-the-box. One further step is that **build steps are actual symbols** (expression-bodied properties) and therefore provide superior navigation and type-safety.<!-- NUKE supports a variety of CLI tools commonly used in .NET  Utilizing **code-generation for CLI tool support** allows NUKE to powerful, flexible and consistent API for-->
